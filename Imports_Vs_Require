For Require--

require     module.exports


for import

we have export


Apart from that,

You can't selectively load only the pieces you need with require but with imports, you can selectively load only the pieces you need. That can save memory.

Loading is synchronous(step by step) for require on the other hand import can be asynchronous(without waiting for previous import) so it can perform a little better than require.

The major difference between require and import, is that require will automatically scan node_modules to find modules, but import, which comes from ES6, won't.


'import' should be used with 'export' key words to share variables/arrays/objects between js files:

export default myObject;

//....in another file

import myObject from './otherFile.js';

'require' should be used with 'module.exports'

module.exports = myObject;

//....in another file

var myObject = require('./otherFile.js');
