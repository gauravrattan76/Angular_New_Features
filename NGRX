What is NgRx?
NgRx is a framework for building reactive applications in Angular. NgRx provides state management, isolation of side effects, entity collection management, router bindings, code generation, and developer tools that enhance developers experience when building many different types of applications.




An Angular application is a reactive system. The user clicks on a button, the application reacts to this event and updates the model. The model gets updated, the application propagates the changes through the component tree.
