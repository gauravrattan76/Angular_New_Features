The reduce() method reduces the array to a single value.

The reduce() method executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right).

The return value of the function is stored in an accumulator (result/total).

Note: reduce() does not execute the function for array elements without values.

var arr = [2,1,11];

var s = arr.reduce(function(acc,num){
    return acc +num;
},4);

console.log(s);

arr.splice mutates the original array.
